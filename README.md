# Pahe Bypasser

A buggy method to automate link grabbing from pahe (It is what it is)

## How To Run

```bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   playwright install chromium
   playwright install-deps chromium
   python main.py

   change LINK_TYPE in identifiers.py accordingly
```

### What's New

   Updated the pahe script

   Migrated the code base from selenium to playwright

   No need to setup webdrivers and browsers seperately

### NOTE

   Feel free to open issues!
